# <a name="top"></a> Obtaining the StorageOS Media
Please make sure you have read the [Installation Requirements](deployment.html) document before proceeding.

The required media for your installation may have been provided by us on a USB flash drive. It can also be downloaded directly from our web site.

## <a name="Downloading"></a> Downloading the StorageOS media
The StorageOS ISO or Vagrantfile can be downloaded from one of the following locations:

  * &#x1F4BF; [ISO Media](https://downloads.storageos.com/images/storageos-ubuntu-16.04-amd64.iso)
  * &#x1F4E6; [Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile)

>**&#x26A0;** During the closed beta period, a password is required to download the installation media.  Please contact [support@storageos.com](mailto:support@storageos.com) if you don't have a working username and password.

Once downloaded, the Vagrantfile installer should be moved to a base folder, for example, `~/storageos`. Make sure that your base folder
has enough free space to install three nodes with the amount of storage you require. We recommend at the very least 30GB of free space
for a three-node cluster. If you intend to use many large volumes, more space will of course be required.
