# II. Obtaining the Installation Media
Depending on your choice of installation, ISO or Vagrant, you need to have completed the installation of the prerequisite components covered earlier in this guide.

The required media for your installation will have either been provided to you directly by us on a USB flash drive or, alternatively it can be downloaded directly from our web site.

## A. <a name="Downloading"></a> Downloading the StorageOS media
The StorageOS ISO or Vagrant image can be downloaded from one of the following locations to a temporary folder:

  - &#x1F4BF; [**ISO Media**](https://downloads.storageos.com/images/storageos-ubuntu-16.04-amd64.iso)
  - &#x1F4E6; [**Vagrant Media**](https://downloads.storageos.com/images/storageos-vagrant.zip)


You must specify the following username and password to download the image.

 - Username: **download**

 - Password: __roh6kei7Oig2__

>**&#x26A0; Warning**: Do not give out the username/password to anyone who has not signed our NDA as you will be breaking the terms you agreed to.

Once downloaded the Vagrant package should be unpacked into a base folder, for example, ~/storageos, where you will have at least 30GB of avaialble space to bring up a 3-node cluster, and more if you want to make this bigger.
