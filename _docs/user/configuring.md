# Configuring your storage environment

## Labels
From the Labels link, you can manage how you title your storage using color and text and by identifying or classifying your system, storage, nodes, and features in a way that makes sense to you. For example, StorageOS comes packaged with the following label types:

* Application types
* Drivers (storage drivers)
* Business unit
* Location (Datacentre location)
* Environment (deployment environment)
* Features (storage features)

This section describes how labels work.

StorageOS provides features (prebuilt, read-only functionality) that you can assign to your storage volumes using labels. The Rules engine allows you to assign these features; for example, to compress the data by default (by assigning the compression tag and making it active) or to replicate production volumes within specific conditions.

These labels also let you implement naming standards for all volumes created in an environment. For example, if you want all volumes to be named

### Creating a new label type
To create a new label:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Label Management window and click __New Label Type__.

 You can then create a business unit type by choosing __New Label__ in the Business Unit section, giving it a name and type, then clicking __Save__.

2. At the top of the window, enter a name for the label type, choose a color, then click __Save__. A message box indicates that your label has been saved, and the new label (Business Unit in this example), appears in the Label Management menu.
